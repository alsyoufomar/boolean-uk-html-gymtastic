    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Gym and Fitness was founded in 2002 as a family owned and operated <br />
      business. The Gym and Fitness founders didn’t want it to be just
      another<br />
      gym equipment retailer - they wanted to be the best in the industry and<br />
      set their minds to doing so! Since its birth, Gym and Fitness has grown<br />
      into one of UK’s largest online fitness equipment retailers having<br />
      helped over 50,000 customers live longer, happier and healthier lives
    </p>
